Plugin for Process Hacker 2 (http://processhacker.sourceforge.net), displays system hooks and able to unhook (right click menu).

Grab the Process Hacker source and compile it, then add HookTools.vcxproj to Plugins.sln. VS 2013 was used. Set your library path in VC++ directories.

This project is based on https://github.com/jay/gethooks.git

As of 2017/02/22 should work on Windows 8.1/10 but not Creators update/insider preview. 64 bit only. Notice the PH V3 branch also.
